 Hello, different forces affect us through the day. That is stress. We face different sources of stress, such as frustration after losing a game. But if we can cope with stress, that's a positive thing for us. A tough but one match makes us proud and motivates us. Too long and too much stress has different effects. For example heart racing, nervousness but also conflicts with others. That's why we need to take care and train our bodies and minds. That's good for us and for others.
